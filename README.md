#MUREX 

MUREX is an exploration of a mysterious island and the cult that used to run it. 

# What's the deal here? 
It's not perfect, we know that. We had some plans for this proj that got way-laid by summer weather. 

Then we got excited for another project and...you know how that goes. Started that before we tied up _any_ ends at all here. 

That being said, please! Play MUREX! Explore MUREX! Here's a few things to know: 

* The whole clues/notebook gameplay thing doesn't exactly work. 
* Forgive us for any repeititive loops you might find yourself trapped in. 

# How to play? 
Open up terminal (hey experts! don't knock the people who don't know what that is). Then, type in the following: 
```
git clone https://github.com/wednesdays4ever/murex.git
```
Once the file has downloaded, then type in: 
```python rooms.py```

If you find a bug, tell us. If you have fun, tell us. If you hate it, keep it to yourself, you know? 

# For the future? 
Next up: the bogs.
