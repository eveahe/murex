IT'S PAINFUL.
THAT'S A QUOTE FROM SOMEWHERE.
He sighs again. Your sympathy for this sad man has turned to boredom bordering on disgust, and he can sense the shift.
BE THERE SOON, HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO, he says before he clomps away, leaving you alone again.
Was that a threat? What are you getting yourself into?

You remember not being able to sleep that night, wondering if you were being held back from some great adventure.
Perhaps that's why you didn't tell your mother when you received the letter,
or when you bought your ticket.
Well, you've made your decision, and there's nothing she can do to prevent you now.

WHEN I WAS A YOUNG GIRL, HE RAN OFF WITH A STRANGE GROUP OF PEOPLE.
CULTISTS. DARK MESSENGERS.
PREACHING SOME NONSENSE ABOUT THE TRUTH BELOW.
HE ASKED US, OUR WHOLE FAMILY, TO JOIN HIM, AND WHEN WE SAID NOW, WHEN WE TOLD HIM HE WAS BEING RIDICULOUS,
HE TOOK ME WITH HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
I WAS PACKED IN A WOODEN TRUNK.
THEY WHISPERED TO ME. HORRIBLE THINGS THAT WERE MEANT TO BE REASSURING.
THEY SOUNDED HOPEFUL WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THE FLOODING OF THE WORLD.
REBORN IN ITS LIGHT THEY SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
THEIR LAUGHTER AND THE SMELL. GOD, THE SMELL.
SOUR. SEWAGE. PICKLED HELL.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY TOOK ME OR WHAT THEY WERE PLANNING TO DO.
I JUST REMEMBER THE POLICE PRYING OPEN THE TOPE OF MY TRUNK, AND STEPPING OUT INTO AN EMPTY BASEMENT,
AND THE WALLS WERE CARVED WITH WAVES. ENDLESS. THOUSANDS OF THEM.

Her eyes went far away then, and they didn't take you with them.
